# Pairs!
A Java console application designed to assist mathematics students working with radicals, radical expressions and factorisation of trinomials. 
"x-variable" refers to the middle variable in a trinomial. It is important to note that this revision of the application can only handle trinomials where the square
(or the first variable) has a coefficient of 0. Future versions of Pairs! will integrate the functionality to handle squares with coefficients higher than 0.
Thank you!
